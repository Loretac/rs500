Huge amounts of illicit materials, yards and yards of this wretched stuff. Days and nights would just go on and on.\u201d\\nThis frenzied, decadent vibe lent a highly charged, confessional aura to such songs as Buckingham\u2019s \u201cGo Your Own Way,\u201d Nicks\u2019 \u201cDreams,\u201d Christine\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop,\u201d and the group-composed anthem to betrayal, \u201cThe Chain.\u201d The band\u2019s soap opera fueled its own intricate creative conversation; on \u201cYou Make Loving Fun,\u201d Christine sang about her new boyfriend, the band\u2019s lighting designer, as her ex John dutifully drives home the song with a sunny, funky bass line. To write \u201cDreams,\u201d Nicks sat on a black velvet bed in a tiny room hidden deep in the Record Plant, where the band was recording, creating one of her most haunting songs in 10 minutes. \u201c[In \u2018Go Your Own Way\u2019] Lindsey is saying go ahead and date other men and go live your crappy life, and [I\u2019m] singing about the rain washing you clean,\u201d Nicks said. \u201cWe were coming at it from opposite angles, but we were really saying the same exact thing.\u201d The Mac\u2019s catchy expos\xe9s, produced with California-sunshine polish, touched a nerve: Rumours became the sixth-best-selling album of all time.","Apple Music Link":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/rumours/594061854","Image Link":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/R1344-007-Fleetwood-Mac-RUMOURS.jpg?w=1000"},{"Rank":6,"Artist":"Nirvana","Album":"Nevermind","Year":1991,"Description":"An overnight-success story of the 1990s, Nirvana\u2019s second album and its totemic \ufb01rst single, \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit,\u201d shot up from the Northwest underground \u2014 the nascent grunge scene in Seattle \u2014 to kick Michael Jackson\u2019s Dangerous off the top of the Billboard charts and blow hair metal off the map. Few albums have had such an overpowering impact on a generation \u2014 a nation of teens suddenly turned punk \u2014 and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator. The weight of success led already-troubled singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain to take his own life in 1994.\\nBut his slashing riffs, corrosive singing, and deviously oblique writing \u2014 rammed home by the Zeppelin-via-Pixies might of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl \u2014 put warrior purity back in rock & roll. Lyrically, Cobain raged in code \u2014 shorthand grenades of inner tumult and self-loathing. His genius, though, in songs like \u201cLithium,\u201d\u2008\u201cBreed,\u201d and \u201cTeen Spirit\u201d was the soft-loud tension he created between verse and chorus, restraint and assault. Cobain was a pop lover at heart \u2014 and a Beatlemaniac: Nevermind co-producer Butch Vig remembered hearing Cobain play John Lennon\u2019s \u201cJulia\u201d at sessions. Cobain also fought to maintain his underground honor with songs like the scabrous punk purge \u201cTerritorial Pissings.\u201d\\n Ultimately, it was a losing battle, but it is part of this album\u2019s enduring power. Vig recalled when Cobain was forced to overdub the guitar intro to \u201cTeen Spirit\u201d because he couldn\u2019t nail it live with the band:\u2008\u201cThat pissed him off.

That January, the Beatles were on the verge of a breakup, exhausted and angry with one another after the disastrous sessions for the aborted Get Back LP, later salvaged as Let It Be [see No. 342]. Yet determined to go out with the same glory with which they had \ufb01rst entranced the world at the start of the decade, the group reconvened at EMI\u2019s Abbey Road Studios to make their most polished album: a collection of superb songs cut with an attention to re\ufb01ned detail, then segued together (especially on Side Two) with conceptual force.\\nThere was no thematic link, other than the Beatles\u2019 unique genius. John Lennon veered from the stormy metal of \u201cI\u2008Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u201d to the exquisite vocal sunrise of \u201cBecause.\u201d Paul McCartney was saucy (\u201cOh! Darling\u201d), silly (\u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u201d), and deliciously bitter (\u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money\u201d). George Harrison proved his long-secret worth as a composer with \u201cSomething\u201d\u2008(later covered by Frank Sinatra) and the folk-pop diamond \u201cHere Comes the Sun,\u201d written in his friend Eric Clapton\u2019s garden after a grim round of business meetings. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison reputedly sang more three-part harmonies here than on any other Beatles album. That warm feeling \u2014 a sense of an increasingly divided band warmly coming together as friends \u2014 may be one reason Abbey Road has become the most beloved Beatles album of all time.","Apple Music Link":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/abbey-road-2019-mix/1474815798","Image Link":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/R1344-005-Beatles-ABBEY-ROAD.jpg?w=1000"},{"Rank":4,"Artist":"Stevie Wonder","Album":"Songs in the Key of Life","Year":1976,"Description":"Months before the recording sessions for Songs in the Key of Life ended, the musicians in Stevie Wonder\u2019s band had T-shirts made up that proclaimed, \u201cWe\u2019re almost finished.\u201d It was the stock answer to casual fans and Motown executives and everybody who\u2019d fallen in love with Wonder\u2019s early-Seventies gems \u2013 1972\u2019s Talking Book, 1973\u2019s Innervisions, and 1974\u2019s Fulfillingness\u2019 First Finale \u2013 and who had been waiting two years for the next chapter. \u201cI believed there was a lot that needed to be said,\u201d Wonder said. More, in fact, than he could fit onto a double album \u2013 also included was a bonus EP, a seven-inch single with four more songs from the sessions.\\nSongs, released in 1976, encompasses an incredible range of life experiences \u2013 from the giddy joy of a baby in the bathtub (\u201cIsn\u2019t She Lovely,\u201d featuring the cries and giggles of Wonder\u2019s infant daughter Aisha Morris) through tributes to his musical heroes (\u201cSir Duke\u201d) to dismay about the indifference of the wealthy (\u201cVillage Ghetto Land\u201d). Wonder pulled from every imaginable musical source \u2014 the ecstatic \u201cSir Duke\u201d references Duke Elington and Ella Fitzgerald, while \u201cAs\u201d featured Herbie Hancock on Fender Rhodes. \\nThough Wonder\u2019s blindness meant he could record faster by memorizing lyrics, some songs had four or five intricate verses, so somebody had to prompt him. Often it was engineer John Fischbach, reading lines into the headphone mix just seconds before Wonder sang them. \u201cHe never got thrown off,\u201d engineer John Fischbach told Rolling Stone years later. \u201cHis vocals had so much power.\u201d\\nThe album\u2019s mastery of many styles remains astonishing, but the feat might not have meant so much had Wonder not delivered some of his most impassioned political art as well, like the autobiographical \u201cI Wish,\u201d the takedown of wealthy complacency \u201cVillage Ghetto Land,\u201d and, perhaps most movingly, \u201cBlack Man,\u201d in which he runs down a funky list of global Afro-diasporic aspirations and heroes.

Let\u2019s see if they can take it. Let\u2019s get real.\u2019 So I wrote Blue.\u201d\\nFrom its smoky, introspective cover to its wholly unguarded approach to songwriting, Blue is the first time any major rock or pop artist had opened up so fully, producing what might be the ultimate breakup album and setting a still-unmatched standard for confessional poetry in pop music. Using acoustic instruments and her octave-leaping voice, Mitchell portrayed herself as a lonely painter, aching to make sense of all her heartbreak. She reflects on past relationships and encounters, including a chef from Crete (\u201cCarey\u201d) and rock luminaries like Graham Nash (\u201cMy Old Man\u201d), Leonard Cohen (\u201cA Case of You\u201d), and James Taylor (\u201cThis Flight Tonight\u201d), who lent a hand on a few tracks. Along with its romantic melancholy, Blue was the sound of a woman availing herself of the romantic and sexual freedom that was, until then, an exclusively male province in rock.\\nThe songs had such stark, emotional intensity that it shocked the men around her: \u201cKris Kristofferson said to me, \u2018Oh, Joni. Save something for yourself.\u2019 The vulnerability freaked them out.\u201d On \u201cLittle Green,\u201d she opens up about a baby she had given up for adoption, and on the staggering piano dirge \u201cRiver,\u201d she takes responsibility for a romance gone wrong, changing the scope of love songs forever: \u201cI\u2019m so hard to handle/I\u2019m selfish, and I\u2019m sad,\u201d she laments. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gone and lost the best baby/That I ever had.\u201d\\nMitchell continued to release excellent records throughout the Seventies, but Blue remains her masterpiece. \u201cThe Blue album, there\u2019s hardly a dishonest note in the vocals,\u201d she told Rolling Stone in 1979. \u201cAt that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world, and I couldn\u2019t pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy.

The Beatles made a point of echoing them on Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band \u2013 an acknowledgment that Pet Sounds was the inspiration for the Beatles\u2019 masterpiece. That gesture actually completed a circle of in\ufb02uence: Wilson initially conceived of Pet Sounds as an effort to top the Beatles\u2019 Rubber Soul. With its vivid orchestration, lyrical ambition, elegant pacing, and thematic coherence, Pet Sounds invented \u2014 and in several senses, perfected \u2014 the notion that an album could be more than the sum of its parts. When Wilson sang, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if we were older,\u201d on the album\u2019s magnificent opening song, he wasn\u2019t just imagining a love that could evolve past high school, he was suggesting a new grown-up identity for rock & roll music itself.\\nWilson made Pet Sounds without the rest of the band, using them only to \ufb02esh out the vocal arrangements. He even considered putting the album out as a solo project, and the \ufb01rst single, \u201cCaroline, No,\u201d was released under his own name. The personal nature of the songs, which Wilson co-wrote primarily with lyricist Tony Asher, further distinguished the album from the Beach Boys\u2019 previous hits. Its luxurious sound conveys a heartbreaking wistfulness, as songs such as \u201cI Just Wasn\u2019t Made for These Times\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Waiting for the Day\u201d bid farewell to the innocent world of the early Sixties.\\nThe album\u2019s centerpiece is \u201cGod Only Knows,\u201d arranged with harpsichord, horns, sleigh bells, and strings to create a spiritual feeling Wilson later compared to \u201cbeing blind, but in being blind, you can see more. You close your eyes; you\u2019re able to see a place or something that\u2019s happening.\u201d In the years to come, countless artists would live in his vision.","Apple Music Link":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pet-sounds/1440841241","Image Link":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/R1344-002-Beach-Boys-PET-SOUNDS-update.jpg?w=1000"},{"Rank":1,"Artist":"Marvin Gaye","Album":"What\'s Going On","Year":1971,"Description":"Marvin Gaye\u2019s masterpiece began as a reaction to police brutality. In May 1969, Renaldo \u201cObie\u201d Benson, the Four Tops\u2019 bass singer, watched TV coverage of hundreds of club-wielding cops breaking up the People\u2019s Park, a protest hub in Berkeley. Aghast at the violence, Benson began to write a song with Motown lyricist Al Cleveland, trying to capture the confusion and pain of the times. He knew he had something big in his nascent version of \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d but the rest of the Four Tops weren\u2019t interested, and Benson\u2019s efforts to get Joan Baez to record it didn\u2019t work out, either.\\nBut one of Motown\u2019s biggest stars and greatest voices turned out to be more receptive. Gaye was in a dark and contemplative place, wounded by the death of his frequent duet partner Tammi Terrell, yearning to sing subtler and more substantive material, and mulling over his brother Frankie\u2019s horrifying tales of his recent stint fighting in Vietnam. Gaye had been keeping busy writing for and producing a group called the Originals, and trying to figure out what was next. \u201cI\u2019d been stumbling around for an idea,\u201d he told biographer David Ritz. \u201cI knew there was more inside me. And that was something no record executive or producer could see. But I saw it. I knew I had to get out there.\u201d\\nAfter some hesitation, Gaye embraced \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d and with the help of arranger David Van De Pitte, crafted a version of the song that was jazzier and more sophisticated than any Motown recording to date, layering cinematic strings over James Jamerson\u2019s supernaturally sinuous bass line and a polyrhythmic groove. Gaye unleashed one of his most spectacular vocal performances in a career full of them, scatting and improvising around the main melody.\\nMotown Records founder Berry Gordy initially resisted releasing \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d telling Gaye that he thought scatting was out of date and protest lyrics were too commercially risky. But when the song became an instant hit, Gordy gave Gaye a single month to craft an album to accompany \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On.\u201d Gaye more than rose to the challenge. \u201cI work best under pressure and when I\u2019m depressed,\u201d he told the Detroit Free Press at the time. \u201cThe world\u2019s never been as depressing as it is right now. We\u2019re killing the planet, killing our young men in the streets, and going to war around the world. Human rights \u2026 that\u2019s the theme.\u201d\\nWhat emerged was soul music\u2019s first concept album, and one of the most important and influential LPs ever made. John Legend recently described it as \u201cthe voice of black America speaking out that we couldn\u2019t always smile on cue for you.\u201d Building it all around one finished song lent What\u2019s Going On a musical and thematic through line. \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening Brother\u201d assumes the voice of a Vietnam vet like Gaye\u2019s brother, puzzled by a changing America and looking for work; \u201cMercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\u201d is a taut ode to the environment; \u201cFlyin\u2019 High (In the Friendly Sky)\u201d takes on drug addiction.\\nAfter What\u2019s Going On, black musicians at Motown and elsewhere felt a new freedom to push the musical and political boundaries of their art. \u201cWhen I was struggling for the right of the Motown artist to express himself,\u201d Gaye said, \u201cStevie [Wonder] knew I was also struggling for him.\u201d\\nAt the end of the final song on What\u2019s Going On, the lament \u201cInner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\u201d the music shifts back into a jazzier reprise of the title track. As the album fades out, the groove continues on.
