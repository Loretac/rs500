The Beatles made a point of echoing them on Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band \u2013 an acknowledgment that Pet Sounds was the inspiration for the Beatles\u2019 masterpiece. That gesture actually completed a circle of in\ufb02uence: Wilson initially conceived of Pet Sounds as an effort to top the Beatles\u2019 Rubber Soul. With its vivid orchestration, lyrical ambition, elegant pacing, and thematic coherence, Pet Sounds invented \u2014 and in several senses, perfected \u2014 the notion that an album could be more than the sum of its parts. When Wilson sang, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if we were older,\u201d on the album\u2019s magnificent opening song, he wasn\u2019t just imagining a love that could evolve past high school, he was suggesting a new grown-up identity for rock & roll music itself.\\nWilson made Pet Sounds without the rest of the band, using them only to \ufb02esh out the vocal arrangements. He even considered putting the album out as a solo project, and the \ufb01rst single, \u201cCaroline, No,\u201d was released under his own name. The personal nature of the songs, which Wilson co-wrote primarily with lyricist Tony Asher, further distinguished the album from the Beach Boys\u2019 previous hits. Its luxurious sound conveys a heartbreaking wistfulness, as songs such as \u201cI Just Wasn\u2019t Made for These Times\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Waiting for the Day\u201d bid farewell to the innocent world of the early Sixties.\\nThe album\u2019s centerpiece is \u201cGod Only Knows,\u201d arranged with harpsichord, horns, sleigh bells, and strings to create a spiritual feeling Wilson later compared to \u201cbeing blind, but in being blind, you can see more. You close your eyes; you\u2019re able to see a place or something that\u2019s happening.\u201d In the years to come, countless artists would live in his vision.","Apple Music Link":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/pet-sounds/1440841241","Image Link":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/R1344-002-Beach-Boys-PET-SOUNDS-update.jpg?w=1000"},{"Rank":1,"Artist":"Marvin Gaye","Album":"What\'s Going On","Year":1971,"Description":"Marvin Gaye\u2019s masterpiece began as a reaction to police brutality. In May 1969, Renaldo \u201cObie\u201d Benson, the Four Tops\u2019 bass singer, watched TV coverage of hundreds of club-wielding cops breaking up the People\u2019s Park, a protest hub in Berkeley. Aghast at the violence, Benson began to write a song with Motown lyricist Al Cleveland, trying to capture the confusion and pain of the times. He knew he had something big in his nascent version of \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d but the rest of the Four Tops weren\u2019t interested, and Benson\u2019s efforts to get Joan Baez to record it didn\u2019t work out, either.\\nBut one of Motown\u2019s biggest stars and greatest voices turned out to be more receptive. Gaye was in a dark and contemplative place, wounded by the death of his frequent duet partner Tammi Terrell, yearning to sing subtler and more substantive material, and mulling over his brother Frankie\u2019s horrifying tales of his recent stint fighting in Vietnam. Gaye had been keeping busy writing for and producing a group called the Originals, and trying to figure out what was next. \u201cI\u2019d been stumbling around for an idea,\u201d he told biographer David Ritz. \u201cI knew there was more inside me. And that was something no record executive or producer could see. But I saw it. I knew I had to get out there.\u201d\\nAfter some hesitation, Gaye embraced \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d and with the help of arranger David Van De Pitte, crafted a version of the song that was jazzier and more sophisticated than any Motown recording to date, layering cinematic strings over James Jamerson\u2019s supernaturally sinuous bass line and a polyrhythmic groove. Gaye unleashed one of his most spectacular vocal performances in a career full of them, scatting and improvising around the main melody.\\nMotown Records founder Berry Gordy initially resisted releasing \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d telling Gaye that he thought scatting was out of date and protest lyrics were too commercially risky. But when the song became an instant hit, Gordy gave Gaye a single month to craft an album to accompany \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On.\u201d Gaye more than rose to the challenge. \u201cI work best under pressure and when I\u2019m depressed,\u201d he told the Detroit Free Press at the time. \u201cThe world\u2019s never been as depressing as it is right now. We\u2019re killing the planet, killing our young men in the streets, and going to war around the world. Human rights \u2026 that\u2019s the theme.\u201d\\nWhat emerged was soul music\u2019s first concept album, and one of the most important and influential LPs ever made. John Legend recently described it as \u201cthe voice of black America speaking out that we couldn\u2019t always smile on cue for you.\u201d Building it all around one finished song lent What\u2019s Going On a musical and thematic through line. \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening Brother\u201d assumes the voice of a Vietnam vet like Gaye\u2019s brother, puzzled by a changing America and looking for work; \u201cMercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\u201d is a taut ode to the environment; \u201cFlyin\u2019 High (In the Friendly Sky)\u201d takes on drug addiction.\\nAfter What\u2019s Going On, black musicians at Motown and elsewhere felt a new freedom to push the musical and political boundaries of their art. \u201cWhen I was struggling for the right of the Motown artist to express himself,\u201d Gaye said, \u201cStevie [Wonder] knew I was also struggling for him.\u201d\\nAt the end of the final song on What\u2019s Going On, the lament \u201cInner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\u201d the music shifts back into a jazzier reprise of the title track. As the album fades out, the groove continues on. Five decades later, it still hasn\u2019t stopped.","Apple Music Link":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/whats-going-on/1538081586","Image
